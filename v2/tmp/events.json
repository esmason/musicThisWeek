I have built two six-figure businesses before the age of 30, all while working part-time and enjoying my life \u2013 traveling, building relationships, and spending plenty of time outdoors. But, it wasn\u2019t always this way\u2026 In January 2013, I was a business owner with no income. I was doing all the right things and studying in all the right programs and keeping the right attitude, but my life was a f***ing mess. I would wake up at dawn and start working \u2013 writing blog posts, researching potential speaking opportunities, spending time on social media connecting with potential customers\u2026 and I would work well into the night attending networking events and pretending that I was super successful so people would want to work with me. Months into that kind of business operation, I had absolutely nothing to show for it (unless you count extreme anxiety, multiple meltdowns, and a pile of debt). I knew that I was born to help people in a BIG way, and I could feel in my bones a knowing that I could do it. But\u2026 I was defeated, confused, and headed for a major breakdown.\u00a0 Do you know that feeling? The feeling of exhaustion, confusion, and defeat? Ugh. I knew I wouldn\u2019t give up, but the issues in my life (the debt, the fear that I wouldn\u2019t be able to pay my rent, the creeping thoughts of needing to get another job to make some money) were feeling really BIG, and my potential was starting to feel smaller and smaller. My spouse at the time was fully supporting us financially, working a job he HATED, and his patience for my \u201cI can do this!\u201d business strategy and my major personal development investments had officially worn out.\u00a0 So, I took a major risk. I invested in myself \u201cone more time,\u201d and I didn\u2019t tell my spouse about it. And, I split our finances completely. I told him, \u201cif I cannot buy groceries, have no pity on me. If I cannot buy it, I will not have it.\u201d I\u2019m not promising that you\u2019ll achieve the same exact results within the next 4 months (which, many of our students do), but I do know this\u2026 I had no money, no leads, no connections inviting me to speak at their events, no website, no real business knowledge and no prior success (I didn\u2019t even have a program to sell at that point)\u2026 all leading to very little self confidence. But I had a deep burning desire to help people make a difference in their lives, and to become financially wealthy in the process.\u00a0I can tell, you have that, too. I&#39;ve helped service & product based entrepreneurs to go from a $12k lifetime revenue to passing the 6-figure mark in just 4 months time. When one of our students was asked whether or not Wealth University&#39;s content was helping her grow her business she said, &quot;Ummmm....quadruple plussed my income. I would say it&#39;s working!&quot; I&#39;ve watched out students go from working a really &quot;hard&quot; 40-hour work week (with little financial benefits) to working a simple 10-hour work week and generating 218% more revenue. I&#39;ve shown brand new entrepreneurs, without a clear plan and $0 revenue, get off the ground and generating consistent cash flow in less than 30 days. Here&#39;s what a past Wealth University LIVE attendee had to say (after just day one)... &quot;It&#39;s been amazing to surround myself with women who are strong and willing to push me to be my best... if you&#39;re ever considering working with Amanda, it&#39;s worth every penny. I would have paid 2x as much for what I&#39;ve learned in just the first day.&quot; I&#39;ll continue sharing these incredible success stories to propose that... You, too, can generate serious income and increase your impact at incredible levels without all the struggle. And at Wealth University LIVE, I&#39;ll show you exactly HOW I did, and exactly HOW our students do it over and over again. This is a 2-day experience in San Francisco, CA, and you&#39;ll not only be deeply immersed in the teaching and tools you need to make 2016 your most successful year ever, you&#39;ll also be surrounded by empowering, open-minded, high-achieving entrepreneurs who are in the same boat as you. They&#39;re ready to hear your story, encourage you to grow, and connect with you on a deep level. So... do you want: Clarity about what you want to create and what your business offers the world? An understanding of HOW to communicate what you&#39;re selling so people JUMP at the opportunity to buy it? A confidence that you know WHAT to spend your time doing each day to ensure you reach your goals? A clear buying process so you get a clear &quot;yes&quot; or clear &quot;no,&quot; so you&#39;re not chasing people down or feel like you&#39;re pushing them to make a decision? AND a firm understanding of WHERE your ideal customers/clients are so you know what to do to sign new people EVERY single week? Join us at Wealth University LIVE, and I&#39;ll make sure you have EVERYTHING you need to get to that next level of your business. Because, 2016 is supposed to be YOUR big year, right?! I like to keep this event intimate, to ensure that I really get the time to know and connect with you.\u00a0 There are only 15 seats available, and we will sell out. Reserve your seat now for this high energy event which includes spiritual AND practical tools that will give you exactly what you need to grow your business from where it is now to where you would LOVE for it to be by the end of\u00a0 2016. I deeply believe that your becoming wealthy is the greatest gift you can give to the world - it&#39;s such a privilege to show people how they can increase their income and their impact, all while taking plenty of time to enjoy life. If you&#39;re feeling &quot;on the fence&quot; about whether or not this event is right for you, feel free to sign up for a time to talk directly with me, Amanda Loveland, to ask your questions and understand more fully whether or not this event is the place for you: SIGN UP TO ASK QUESTIONS with Amanda I&#39;ll look forward to seeing you at Wealth University LIVE on April 29 & 30 in San Francisco, CA!

Edward Slingerland is professor of Asian studies and Canada Research Chair in Chinese Thought and Embodied Cognition at the University of British Columbia, where he also holds adjunct appointments in philosophy and psychology. His book Trying Not to Try was a Guardian Best Book of 02014 and chosen by Brain Pickings as Best Book on Psychology / Philosophy for that year. &quot;Slingerland\u2019s book exemplifies the very principles it elucidates.

BCE) China. This work will call into question neo-Orientalist myths about Chinese or \u201cEastern\u201d thought. He is also researching the role of intoxicants and ecstatic experience in the rise of human civilization, and he is continuing to direct an international, interdisciplinary project on the evolution of religion and morality. Long Now is pleased to continue our collaboration with CASBS. This is the second of several Interval talks\u00a0this year that will feature 02016 CASBS fellows. Since 01954 CASBS has been a preeminent national and international locus for cutting-edge, interdisciplinary, and transformative thinking and research on some of the most important challenges and issues. Its aim is discovery in the service of advancing social science methods, theories, and topics that address and answer socially significant questions. At the heart of the CASBS enterprise is its residential fellowship program, which attracts the finest minds from psychology, sociology, economics, political science, anthropology, history, philosophy, linguistics, and related disciplines. Edward Slingerland is professor of Asian studies and Canada Research Chair in Chinese Thought and Embodied Cognition at the University of British Columbia, where he also holds adjunct appointments in philosophy and psychology. His research specialties and teaching interests include early Chinese thought, religious studies (comparative religion, cognitive science of religion), cognitive linguistics (blending and conceptual metaphor theory), ethics (virtue ethics, moral psychology), and the relationship between the humanities and the natural sciences. He earned his B.A. with Distinction from Stanford University in Chinese (01991), his M.A. in classical Chinese from UC Berkeley (01994), and his Ph.D. in Religious Studies from Stanford (01998), where he wrote his dissertation on the topic of wu-wei and the paradox of wu-wei\u2014the first major academic treatment of this topic. His books include Effortless Action: Wu-wei as Conceptual Metaphor and Spiritual Ideal in Early China (02003), What Science Offers the Humanities: Integrating Body & Culture (02008), and Trying Not to Try (02014), and a co-editor of Creating Consilience: Integrating the Sciences and the Humanities (02011).
